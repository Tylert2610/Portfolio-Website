- Always use the linear MCP server to reference the development plan and open issues. The team name is Portfolio Website
- Creating a linear issue syncs to github issues
- Feel free to suggest adding new issues to this linear team if you identify a bug or see a clear feature that should probably be added to the roadmap
- Apply relevant labels to issues
- Do not insert next steps into issues. If next steps are needed, create a new issue or find an existing issue that is related and add a comment to it.
